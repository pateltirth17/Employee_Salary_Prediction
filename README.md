# 🧠 Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains a complete machine learning project that aims to **predict employee salaries** based on various features such as experience, test score, and interview score. The project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a regression model using scikit-learn and pandas in Python.

## 🚀 Project Overview

### Objective:
To develop a regression model that accurately predicts the salary of an employee based on:
- Years of experience
- Test score
- Interview score

### Key Features:
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Linear Regression Model Training
- Salary Prediction using user inputs
- Model export using `joblib` for deployment

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-salary-prediction.git
   cd employee-salary-prediction
   ```

2. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the notebook:**
   Open `employee salary prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode to view and run the code step-by-step.

4. **Use the model:**
   The trained model is saved using `joblib`. You can load it and use it in a web app (e.g., Streamlit or Flask) for deployment.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Use more advanced regression models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Build a user interface with Streamlit for interactive predictions
- Expand dataset for better generalization
- Add cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
